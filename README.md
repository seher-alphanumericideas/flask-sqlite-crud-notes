# flask-sqlite-crud-notes

*CODE DESCRIPTION*

I built this Notes App using Flask and SQLite to practice creating a full-stack web application with basic CRUD functionality. The backend is handled with Flask, and I used SQLite for the database since it's lightweight and easy to set up. When the app runs, it automatically creates the database and a notes table if they don’t already exist.

On the frontend, I kept things simple with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The page has a form where I can add notes, and each note shows up with options to edit or delete. I used fetch() in JavaScript to make API calls to the Flask routes for creating, updating, and deleting notes without refreshing the page.

This project helped me understand how to connect the frontend to a backend API and manage a database through Flask. It’s a clean, minimal setup that I can build on later if I want to add things like user accounts or search functionality.
